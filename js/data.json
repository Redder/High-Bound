As an arts school, LoMA integrates visual and performance elements into all of our students’ days. Students have the opportunity to work with artists during academic classes to create high quality, standards-based performances of learning. Our school has partnerships with many Lower East Side arts organizations so that every student takes part in an Extended Day Program at least twice a week. To support our students’ success at meeting these higher standards, we maintain an intimate, nurturing community with a large number of adults watching over and taking care of our students.",

We have received awards for our work in this rebuilding. Our students not only get their core academic courses, but can also commit to one of six career academies. With millions of dollars in scholarships earned by our seniors each year, internships for students starting freshman year and students moving on to prestigious universities like Fordham, NYU, St. John’s, and Penn State, the question shouldn’t be, ‘Why should I attend Truman?’ but rather, ‘Why would I go anywhere else?’ It is a class-leading education, close to home.

Our goal as a school is to provide our students with a rich learning environment that will well prepare them for the 21st century. This includes preparing students for college and career choices in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Math) fields and communication. We want our students to be ready for the demands of an increasingly technological workplace. In order to meet these demands, students must have a strong foundation in Math and Science. As part of this groundwork, we work to provide our students with rigorous coursework that promotes collaboration and project-based learning. We continue to support our graduates through alumni events and core college panels. As we empower the ACHS community to transform, “Success is the only Option.”",

Every student at Campos takes daily talent classes of their choice; students become musicians, singers, actors, and visual artists. Partnerships with major community arts organizations, CUNY’s PERC program, and the College Bound Initiative (CBI) ensure that students also connect their learning to the real world and have the opportunity to teach and learn from one another. For example, students conduct gallery openings at professional galleries throughout the city, co-teach STEM classes with teachers in the PERC program, and begin visiting colleges as ninth graders. In addition, an in-house college counselor ensures that students are prepared for college acceptance and enrollment upon graduation. We are small enough to give every student the attention they deserve while being large enough to offer a wide variety of courses and activities during and after the school day. Beginning early in high school, students at Campos visit colleges, earn college credits through Advanced Placement (AP) and CUNY courses, play sports, take on leadership roles, participate in a wide variety of after-school activities, learn about careers in the arts, and are surrounded by teams of adults who offer all of the academic and social support they need to succeed in school. We are prepared to serve any student and value a diverse and richly talented school community.",

In the ninth and tenth grades, PBATs take the form of roundtables: presentations in a small group of students in which students present a final piece of work to staff, families, and visitors. In eleventh and twelfth grades, they are semester-long projects that show a deep understanding of one aspect of a given content in history, science, English, or math. Students also meet with their faculty advisor regularly to discuss academic goals and progress. A wide array of elective classes allows students to pursue their individual academic interests and goals. Courses taught by visiting artists and a solid physical wellness program (including sports, fitness and dance) support our mission of every child achieving their goals and having a happy, healthy, balanced adulthood.",

A strong school community of families, teachers, and staff, equally committed to these high ideals, supports our students and provides a solid foundation for success. BC is committed to developing well-rounded individuals. We offer college courses and specialize in college tours; a typical BC student will have visited 12-15 colleges by senior year. We have an outstanding after-school program with varied activities including “AA” basketball programs for girls and boys. Many of our students have earned academic or athletic scholarships to college. BC is a place where friends are made for life where graduates know they are always welcomed back home.
